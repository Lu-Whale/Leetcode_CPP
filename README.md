## Dynamic Programming

#### When solving Dynamic Programming (DP) problems, it is usually necessary to follow a series of steps. The following is the general logic for solving DP problems:

1. Define the Problem: First, clearly define the problem, including what the input and output of the problem are and how to measure the optimization goal of the problem. This step typically involves breaking down the original problem into **smaller subproblems** to make it manageable.
2. Find Optimal Substructure: Determine if the problem exhibits the property of optimal substructure, where the optimal solution of the problem can be constructed from **the optimal solutions of its subproblems**. This is a key feature of DP problems.
3. Recursively Define States: Once the problem is divided into subproblems, define the state(s) for each subproblem. A state is a description of the subproblem's information and is typically represented by one or more variables that uniquely identify the subproblem.
4. Build the **State Transition Equation**: The state transition equation describes the relationship between subproblems, indicating how to transition from one subproblem's solution to the next. This is the core part of DP problems.
5. **Initialize Boundary Conditions:** In DP problems, it is often necessary to initialize one or more initial states with boundary conditions. These boundary conditions represent the base cases of the problem and are usually the solutions to the simplest subproblems.
6. Compute Bottom-Up or Apply Memoization: There are two common methods to solve DP problems. One approach is bottom-up, starting from the smallest subproblems and gradually computing solutions for larger subproblems until the solution for the original problem is obtained. Another approach is memoization, which involves using recursion to solve the problem but storing the solutions for each subproblem in a data structure to avoid redundant calculations.
7. Return the Final Solution: Once the solution to the original problem is computed, return it as the answer to the problem.

### Tips:
- Add extra spaces for dp array to handle edge cases without additional check.
    - int[ ] dp = new int[n + 2];
- Transition Equation could be more than one, depending on different situation need to be considered.
    - Refer to 1143, there are two parts to the transition equation, depending on whether the current characters being considered are the same or not.
### Example Problem

## Binary Search

#### Handling boundary conditions properly in binary search is crucial to avoid infinite loops or missing the target element. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Loop Condition:
    - Binary search is typically performed within a while (left <= right) loop. Using < instead of <= can cause a failure to find edge elements.
    - At the end of the search, left will be greater than right, which indicates that the search space is empty.
2. Midpoint Calculation:
    - Correctly calculating the midpoint can prevent integer overflow, such as int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;.
3. Narrowing Down the Search Space:
    - When the target is less than the value at mid, i.e., target < array[mid], adjust the right boundary to mid - 1.
    - When the target is greater than the value at mid, i.e., target > array[mid], adjust the left boundary to mid + 1.
    - If you're dealing with a standard binary search problem to find an exact value, when target == array[mid], you can return mid or proceed as necessary.
4. Return Condition:
    - If the target value is found in the array, return its index.
    - If the loop ends (i.e., left > right), it indicates that the target value is not in the array, and depending on the function's expectation, you can return a special value, such as -1 or null.
5. Handling Special Cases:
    - Special cases when the array is empty or has only one element.
    - Handling when the target value is less than all elements in the array or greater than all of them.

### Tips:
1. Careful define left and right boundary may handle the edge cases, for example, if index 0 and index n-1 are not the answers, we can initial left = 1, right = n-2

### Example Problem

## Priority Queue

#### An unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap. The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering, or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used. A priority queue does not permit null elements. A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in ClassCastException).

1. `PriorityQueue()`
    - Creates a PriorityQueue with the default initial capacity (11) that orders its elements according to their natural ordering.
2. `PriorityQueue(Comparator<? super E> comparator)`
    - Creates a PriorityQueue with the default initial capacity and whose elements are ordered according to the specified comparator.
3. `PriorityQueue(int initialCapacity, Comparator<? super E> comparator)`
    - Creates a PriorityQueue with the specified initial capacity that orders its elements according to the specified comparator.

Example of how to use lambda expressions to define ascending (min-heap) and descending (max-heap) order for a PriorityQueue:

- #### Ascending Order (Min-Heap):
  `PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a - b);`
- #### Descending Order (Max-Heap):
  `PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);`

### Comparator

In Java, the return value of the compare method in a Comparator defines the ordering relationship between two objects. The signature of the compare method is as follows:

`int compare(T o1, T o2);`

Here, o1 and o2 are the objects to be compared, and T is the type of the objects. The method returns an integer that has three possible outcomes:

1. Negative Number: If the return value is negative, it indicates that the first argument o1 is "less than" the second argument o2. In sorting structures, o1 should appear before o2.
2. Zero: If the return value is zero, it indicates that the two arguments are considered equal. In most sorting structures, this means their order is not significant, and they can be interchanged without affecting the sort order.
3. Positive Number: If the return value is positive, it indicates that the first argument o1 is "greater than" the second argument o2. In sorting structures, o1 should appear after o2.

When you use a Comparator in sorting structures like PriorityQueue or Collections.sort(), the internal sorting algorithms of these structures use the compare method to determine the order of elements. For example:
```
PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<Integer>() {
   @Override
   public int compare(Integer a, Integer b) {
      return a - b; // Negative if a < b, zero if a == b, positive if a > b
   }
});
```
In this example, we create a PriorityQueue where the elements are Integers. We provide a Comparator that defines the ordering between integers by simply subtracting a from b. This Comparator will cause the queue to sort the integers in ascending order (the smallest element has the highest priority).

In Java 8 and above, Comparator creation is often done using lambda expressions or method references for more concise code:

```
// Using a lambda expression to define a Comparator
PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a - b);
```
Or if you are sorting based on an attribute of an object, you can use the Comparator.comparing method:
```
// Assuming the Person class has a method getAge
PriorityQueue<Person> personPriorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparing(Person::getAge));
```
Here, the PriorityQueue will sort Person objects based on their age. A Person with a lower age returned by the getAge method will be considered to have a higher priority in the queue.

## Merge sort
#### Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. Divide: The array is divided into two halves (subarrays).
2. Conquer: Each half is sorted recursively using merge sort, breaking down the subarrays until they are small enough to be considered sorted (arrays of one element are always sorted).
3. Combine: The sorted subarrays are merged together to form a single, sorted array.

### Example Problem
[148. Sort List](Problem_List/_148_Sort_List.java)

## Deep First Search

#### Follow these steps to develop when try to solve depth-first search (DFS) algorithm problems:

1. Understand the Problem: First, fully understand the requirements and objectives of the problem. This might involve traversing a graph, finding paths, solving puzzles, etc.
2. Decide on Graph Representation: Based on the needs of the problem, decide how to represent the graph. This could be an adjacency matrix, adjacency list, or other forms.
3. Design the DFS Recursive Function: Write a recursive function to perform DFS. Common elements to consider include:
    - Visited Marking: To mark nodes that have been visited to prevent revisiting.
    - Path Recording: If needed, record the path from the starting point to the current node.
    - Termination Condition: Decide when to stop the recursion.
4. Handle Special Cases: Consider and handle special cases in the graph, such as cycles, disconnected components, or other specific requirements.
5. Recursive Traversal: Start the DFS from one or multiple starting points and recursively traverse the graph.
6. Collect and Return Results: If the problem requires returning specific results, ensure these are correctly collected during the recursion.
7. Optimization and Debugging:
    - Check for any possible optimizations, such as pruning conditions, to reduce unnecessary recursive calls.
    - Debug the code to ensure it handles various test cases correctly.
8. Code Review and Refactoring: Finally, review the code to ensure clarity and efficiency. If necessary, refactor to improve the readability and performance of the code.

### Tips:

1. When using a variable to track a global maximum or minimum in a recursive function, there are typically two approaches:
    - Global Variable: Define a class-level variable (like maxLen). This variable remains constant throughout all recursive calls and can be updated and accessed accordingly.
    - Function Parameter: By passing the current maximum as a parameter to the recursive function and then returning the updated maximum.

### Example Problem
[1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree](LeetCode75/Binary_Tree_DFS/_1372_Longest_ZigZag_Path_in_a_Binary_Tree.java)

## Backtracking

#### Backtracking used for finding solutions to problems incrementally, one step at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
How backtracking works:
1. Choose:
    - Start by choosing an option at a decision point.
2. Constraint Check:
    - After making a choice, check if the current partial solution satisfies the problem's constraints. If it violates any constraint, discard this partial solution and backtrack (i.e., return to the previous step).
3. Goal Check:
    - Check if the current solution satisfies the goal of the problem. If it does, return this solution.
4. Recursion:
    - If the current partial solution neither violates the constraints nor satisfies the goal, recursively apply these steps to extend the solution further.
5. Backtrack:
    - If none of the options work out, backtrack to the previous decision point and try a different path.

### Example Problem
[17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](LeetCode75/Backtracking/_17_Letter_Combinations_of_a_Phone_Number.java)

## Prefix sum with Hashmap
1. We know the sum of subarray at interval(i,j) can be got by sum[j] - sum[i] = SumOfSubArray
2. Then we just need to use hashmap to store how many sum[i] satisfied this equation when iterate to j
3. Note that be careful the edge case where sum[j] should include the element j and sum[i] should exclude the element i when calculate the exact interval from i to j, but sometimes it can be simplified since it same as sum[j] - sum[i-1]

### Example Problem
- [930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](Problem_List/_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum.java)
- [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](Problem_List/_560_Subarray_Sum_Equals_K.java)
- [1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List](Daily_Question/_1171_Remove_Zero_Sum_Consecutive_Nodes_from_Linked_List.java)

## Graph

### Topological sorting
Topological sorting is an algorithm applied to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that produces a linear ordering of all its vertices such that if there is a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, then u appears before v in the ordering. This is particularly useful in scheduling problems where certain tasks must be performed before others, and there are no cycles in the task dependencies.

There are several algorithms to achieve a topological sort, with Depth-First Search (DFS) being one of the most common. Here's a simplified overview of how the DFS algorithm for topological sorting might work:
1. Pick an unvisited node.
2. Beginning with the selected node, perform a DFS according to the graph's edges.
3. On reaching a node with no unvisited outgoing edges (a leaf node), add the node to the front of a list.
4. Continue until all nodes have been visited and added to the list.
5. The resulting list is a topological order of the graph's vertices.

#### Example Problem: [207. Course Schedule](Top_Interview_150/Graph_General/_207_Course_Schedule.java)

### Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union (DSU))
Union-Find, is a data structure that provides an efficient way to keep track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It's particularly useful for dealing with problems related to network connectivity, finding connected components in graphs, and many other applications where groups of items need to be dynamically combined and queried for whether they are in the same group or not.

The core operations of DSU are find and union:
- **Find**: Determines which subset a particular element is in. This operation can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
- Union: Joins two subsets into a single subset. This operation is used to merge two sets together.

The efficiency of DSU comes from two optimizations:
- Path Compression: During a find operation, the path of nodes visited is compressed to point directly to the root node. This drastically reduces the time complexity for subsequent find operations.
- Union by Rank or Size: When performing a union operation, the smaller set (by rank or size) is merged into the larger set. This helps to keep the tree flat, improving the time complexity of future operations.

#### Implementation: [Union Find](Algorithms/UnionFind.java)

### Dijkstra Algorithm
Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes.

This video from YouTube clearly shows [How Dijkstra's Algorithm Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFg3u_E6eHU)

Here's a basic outline of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:
1. Initialization: Start with the initial node and assign it a tentative distance of 0. For all other nodes, set the initial distance to infinity. Set the initial node as current.
2. Visiting Neighbors: Update the tentative distance to every neighboring node of the current node. The tentative distance is the sum of the current node's distance and the edge weight between the current node and the neighbor. If this distance is less than the previously recorded tentative distance, update it.
3. Marking Node as Visited: Once all neighbors have been visited, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.
4. Selecting the Next Node: Choose the unvisited node with the lowest tentative distance as the next "current node" and repeat the process from step 2.
5. Termination: The algorithm terminates when all nodes have been visited. At this point, the shortest path from the initial node to all other nodes has been determined.



#### Example Problem:
[787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](Daily_Question/_787_Cheapest_Flights_Within_K_Stops.java)


## Sliding Window
### how the sliding window works:
1. Initialization: Start with two pointers or indices that represent the window's edges (usually called left and right). The window size can be fixed or variable depending on the problem.
2. Expand the Window: Move the right pointer to the right (increment it) to expand the window until you meet the specific condition of your problem.
3. Shrink the Window: Once the condition is met, you can try to shrink the window from the left by moving the left pointer to the right (increment it). The goal here is to find the smallest or optimal window that meets the condition. Whether you can or should shrink the window depends on the problem requirements.
4. Update and Record Solutions: As you expand or shrink the window, update any necessary variables or records that pertain to the solution of the problem. For example, if you're looking for the maximum sum, keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far.
5. Repeat: Continue expanding and shrinking the window as needed until you've considered all possible relevant windows in the list or array.

### Tips:
In each iteration of the sliding window, there are two situation:
1. left boundary can be slided and right boundary is fixed
    - Detailed, everytime when right boundary is reached to limited, such as 'res += hashMap.get(left) - left' means how many possible substrings exists where those substrings is ended with the element nums[right]
    - Example Problem: [2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency](Daily_Question/_2958_Length_of_Longest_Subarray_With_at_Most_K_Frequency.java)
2. right boundary can be slided and left boundary is fixed
    - Example Problem: [76 Minimum Window Substring](Top_Interview_150/Sliding_Window/_76_Minimum_Window_Substring.java)

## Bit manipulation
1. Bitwise AND (&): This operation results in a bit pattern where the bits of the result are set to 1 if and only if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1.
    ```
    int a = 12; // 1100 in binary
    int b = 10; // 1010 in binary
    int result = a & b; // 1000 in binary, which is 8
    ```
2. Bitwise OR (|): This operation results in a bit pattern where the bits of the result are set to 1 if either or both of the corresponding bits of the operands are 1.
    ```
    int a = 12; // 1100 in binary
    int b = 10; // 1010 in binary
    int result = a | b; // 1110 in binary, which is 14
    ```
3. Bitwise XOR (^): This operation results in a bit pattern where the bits of the result are set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.
    ```
    int a = 12; // 1100 in binary
    int b = 10; // 1010 in binary
    int result = a ^ b; // 0110 in binary, which is 6
    ```
4. Bitwise NOT (~): This is a unary operation that flips the bits of the operand.
    ```
    int a = 12; // 1100 in binary
    int result = ~a; // In a 32-bit system, it results in 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110011
    ```
5. Left Shift (<<): This shifts the bits of the operand to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the new bits on the right with zeros. It effectively multiplies the number by 2^n.
    ```
    int a = 3; // 11 in binary
    int result = a << 2; // 1100 in binary, which is 12
    ```
6. Right Shift (>>): This shifts the bits of the operand to the right by a specified number of positions. If the number is positive, the leftmost bits are filled with the original leftmost bit (sign bit). If the number is negative, the leftmost bits are filled with zeros.
    ```
    int a = -8; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000 in binary
    int result = a >> 2; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111110 in binary, which is -2
    ```
7. Unsigned Right Shift (>>>): This shifts the bits of the operand to the right by a specified number of positions, filling the leftmost bits with zeros regardless of the sign of the original number.
    ```
    int a = -8; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000 in binary
    int result = a >>> 2; // 00111111 11111111 11111111 11111110 in binary
    ```
